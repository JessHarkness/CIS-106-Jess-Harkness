# CIS-106-Jess-Harkness
## Assignment 1
In 2020, I graduated from the University of Vermont with a B.S. in animal science and a minor in wildlife biology. I have been working in the general realm of conservation biology since graduating, mostly doing fieldwork jobs. I have recently decided that I want to pivot my career trajectory into GIS, which is an increasingly important tool used in conservation work. I enrolled in Harper's GIS Certificate program in June and chose to take this course (CIS 106) as my elective for the program. Familiarity with computer programming is an in-demand skill in the field of GIS, and I hope to make myself a more competitive applicant for jobs in the future with the skillset that I learn in this course. I also think it will be valuable simply for knowledge's sake to learn more about how computers and information systems function at a fundamental level.
