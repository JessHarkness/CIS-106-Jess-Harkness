# CIS-106-Jess-Harkness

## Assignment 1

In 2020, I graduated from the University of Vermont with a B.S. in animal science and a minor in wildlife biology. I have been working in the general realm of conservation biology since graduating, mostly doing fieldwork jobs. I have recently decided that I want to pivot my career trajectory into GIS, which is an increasingly important tool used in conservation work. I enrolled in Harper's GIS Certificate program in June and chose to take this course (CIS 106) as my elective for the program. Familiarity with computer programming is an in-demand skill in the field of GIS, and I hope to make myself a more competitive applicant for jobs in the future with the skillset that I learn in this course. I also think it will be valuable simply for knowledge's sake to learn more about how computers and information systems function at a fundamental level.

## Assignment 2
I have chosen Python as the programming language that I will be learning in this course. Python is a very popular coding language, and it is one of the better languages to learn as a beginner because it emphasizes readability. As someone who has no prior programming experience, the relatively straightforward syntax of Python is appealing to me. Initially, I was using GDB Online to test my programs for Assignment 2, but then I downloaded Thonny, and I think that is the IDE I will be using for future assignments. Even after this course has ended, Python will be very useful to me moving forward with my GIS certificate because Python is commonly used in GIS applications (like ArcGIS Pro) to automate geoprocessing tasks.
