# Fall semester: Create a program that reads data from Plant Catalog and builds parallel arrays for the plant items, 
# with each array containing the plant's full name, zone, light, and price, respectively. 
# Availability will be ignored. After reading the data and building the arrays, display the plant items similar to the following:

# common name (botanical name) - zone - light - price

# At the bottom, display the total number of items in the catalog and the average price per item similar to:

# 0 items - $0.00 average price

# This program takes data from the Plant Catalog and displays each plant's common name, botanical name,
# zone, light, and price. The items in the catalog are tallied up and the average price of the items in the
# catalog is calculated.

Input: plant catalog: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/plant_catalog.xml
Processing: the XML file will be opened and read. using a loop (for loop?), useful information will be isolated for each plant item (common name, 
botanical name, zone, light, price)- lines will be cleared of headers and end-of-line designators (ex: <PLANT> <COMMON> </COMMON>, all that will be stripped). an array will be built for each plant item; should look like this: [common name, botanical name, zone, light, price]. number of items will be calculated. average price will be calculated and rounded to 2 decimal places.
Output: plant items will be displayed as: common name (botanical name) - zone - light - price. display total number of items. 
display average price as $0.00
